## Company Introduction

This publicly operated company currently has over 10,000 employees in total and has revenue of over $20 billion over its various business units and 18 branches throughout Canada.

## Business Challenge
This insurance company has Big Data computational requirements for actuarial designs which are executed against a fine range of databases habitually on daily basis. These databases run on nearly 150 Virtual Machines (VMs), and need to frequently be managed, monitored, and upgraded all while enabling Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD) in testing and production environments.

We are looking for a tool that would enable support of our existing tool chain, and customized cloud environment - Chef and VMware with a custom-built distro (distribution - deployment of software - is nearly always used in a Linux context.), while providing strong custom workflows to support the variety of tooling.
